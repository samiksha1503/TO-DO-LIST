üìù **To-Do List App**

### Description:
This project aims to create a straightforward interface for a To-Do List application. Users can perform basic tasks such as adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as complete. The application utilizes Local Storage, eliminating the need for external databases like Oracle or PHPMyAdmin.

### Features:
- **Add Task**: Users can easily add new tasks to the list.
- **Edit Task**: Editing functionality allows users to modify existing tasks.
- **Delete Task**: Unwanted tasks can be removed from the list.
- **Mark as Complete**: Users can mark tasks as complete for better organization.

### Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Instructions for Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Start managing your tasks using the intuitive interface.

### How It Works:
- Upon opening the application, existing tasks stored in Local Storage are loaded onto the interface.
- Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete directly through the interface.
- Changes made by the user are automatically saved to Local Storage, ensuring persistence across sessions.

### Future Enhancements:
- Improve the UI/UX for a more intuitive user experience.
- Implement task prioritization or categorization features.
- Add due date functionality for tasks.
- Incorporate user authentication for personalized task management.



üöÄ Happy task managing!
